# Code-Foo-Submission
Hey guys! I worked on the Backend section of the questions.
I provided the source code for each problem, as well as an executable jar
for some. The answer to the scrabble questions is my Best_Word program.
The AZERTY keyboard converter is in the KeyboardConverter file, and the ISO8601
String converter code is in the DateConverter .java and .jar files. The standalone version
is an executable program I was using for testing. You guys can try it out if you compile it,
should run fine. There are a few bugs in the last 2 questions, but I got pretty close! 

Anyway I hope you guys accept me for the program! I would love to work with you!

Cheers,
Josh
